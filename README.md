## Overview

A game to simulate the exciting experience of being an EMS helicopter pilot. 

Prior to becoming a software engineer, I was a helicopter pilot flying for the University of Pennsylvania. The majority of the flying was conducting interfacility transfers between hospitals. The idea was to take the sickest patient from one hospital and transfer them to a higher level of care. This gameboard is an actual representation of hospitals and routes I used to fly on a regular basis. 

The weather stations in the game are displaying real-time weather for each location. Usually, these stations are located on local airfields. When displaying no color at all the area is clear of poor weather. If around the station it turns blue, that represents marginal VFR condition. Meaning the clouds are low and/or the visibility is reduced. If the area is red, that means its IFR and the clouds are very low, and/or the visibility is severely limited.
