## Overview

A game to simulate the exciting experience of being an EMS helicopter pilot.

Prior to becoming a software engineer, I was a helicopter pilot flying for the University of Pennsylvania. The majority of the flying was conducting interfacility transfers between hospitals. The idea was to take the sickest patient from one hospital and transfer them to a higher level of care. This gameboard is an actual representation of hospitals and routes I used to fly on a regular basis.

If you click the "weather" button, the stations in the game will display real-time weather for each location. The stations will show green for good weather, blue for marginal, and red from poor weather.

To start the game press "Play!" and use the arrow keys for fly around the board. The game will generate a sending hospital, the first one in which you fly to indicated in white. Plus, your destination, the receiving hospital indicated in red. Once, the sending is flown over you're now what we call "Medevac" status, meaning a patient is onboard. As fast as you can, fly to the receiving hospital indicated in red. Once you've completed the route, the patient is tallied and a new flight request is generated.

Don't forget to refuel along the way at your home base. Just press the 'F' button once over the pad. Pay attention to the time as it is limited. Time is of the essence!
